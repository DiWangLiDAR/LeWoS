# LeWoS <br/> 
Tree leaf-wood separation from point cloud data <br/> 

# Usage<br/> 
There are many ways to use this tool.<br/> 
**(a) if you have Matlab installed:**<br/>
Option 1. Call the entry level funtion "RecursiveSegmentation_release.m".<br/> 
Option 2. Type "LeWoS_RS" in Matlab workspace. This will open up an interface by calling the classdef "LeWoS_RS.m". This classdef file defines the interface.<br/> 
Option 3. Drag "LeWoS.mlappinstall" into Matlab workspace. This will install a Matlab App for you. <br/> 
**(b) if you don't have Matlab installed, and don't want to install it:**<br/>
Download the standalone excutable for window system from https://drive.google.com/open?id=1SvQbmRy547MX0QihyatsSaaWkGjosyFk. If you need an excutable for other systems, please contact me.<br/> 

*Note that if you load an ascii point cloud with the interface, only space delimiter is supported. (Recommend to use las files)
